## Welcome to my Capstone Project!

During my 4-weeks Project I built an App called ☁️💖 **Dream Day** 💖☁️

**Dream Day** is a wedding planner App, which helps the user plan their wedding to the details. It has a countdown feature, gallery page with wedding vendor cards sort by category such as venue, photography, bridal, catering etc., in which the user can collect informations about prices, contact and photos of the vendor. The app provides planner feature for the user to create todo list for each vendor and enable them to plan events from engagement party to wedding ceremony. The todo list is designed to help user keep track of their wedding preparation progress. To sweeten up the day, user get to see random quotes of the day on the dashboard ✨
